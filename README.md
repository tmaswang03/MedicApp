Medicapp - A convenient and safe way to see people's medical issues.

# Inspiration:
What makes so many conditions and viruses dangerous, such as Covid and allergies, is the fact that they are not always visually apparent. Oftentimes allergies and other medical conditions are triggered from outside parties that didn’t know you had the medical problem, and this became our inspiration for Medicapp. We wanted it to be easier to access someone’s medical issues so that accidental injuries can be avoided as efficiently as possible, including at locations such as parks, landmarks, and monuments. Medicapp helps with this problem by allowing individuals to upload a selfie which is then connected to their medical conditions so that any other individual can take a picture of them and access their set of medical problems.

# Features:
We used databases to store user data given by the user with all their data being connected to their selfie. Then using apis such as Faceapi for A.I and imgur api for image uploading we can retrieve the data from our databases through a single picture. The Faceapi A.I facilitates the face recognition software that allows us to match a picture of someone with their selfie uploaded in our databases, and we connected all this to our front-end website with tailwind and javascript.

# Challenges:
Not being very experienced with databases and apis this ended up being an extraordinary learning experience. With the help of mentors and the internet we managed to get all of it up and working with very little time to spare. We were also very inexperienced with tailwind so styling became a time consuming task but with hard work and effort we put everything together fairly nicely.

# How we built it:
This project was built using tailwind css and Javascript. Face recognition uses FaceApi to create and match descriptors of the processed faces. Then using a database, we compared the faces to that of previous user profiles. Once we find a match, we access the medical information of the database user. The image uploading uses Imgur api, whenever a user submits a form, a new image with their profile picture is hosted using imgur.

# What we learned:
We learned many technical skills such as styling with tailwind, how to use A.I software such as our Faceapi that was used for face recognition, and how to implement apis efficiently into our projects. We also learned how to connect databases to our web pages as well as how to store data in databases for easy storage and access. We also learned how to collaborate with team members on Github as well as over social media platforms such as discord.

# Opportunities for expansion:
We could potentially have made it a phone app so that it would be more accessible. We can also expand our idea by potentially giving medical advice such as things to not serve food wise given your customer has certain medical conditions.
